# Module 11 Challenge: UFO

## Background and Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge is to help UFO enthusiast Dana by creating an interactive table that filters UFO sightings stored as a JavaScript array.  The [HTML code](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/challenge_final/index.html) allows a user to view both the table and input boxes on a web browser.  The underlying [JavaScript code](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/challenge_final/static/js/app.js) creates multiple filters that react to the user's input.  The [CSS file](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/challenge_final/static/css/style.css) provides customizations to the final product such as adding an image to the jumbotron, creating a dark background, and adding a green outline to the headline text.

## Results:
Upon [opening the webpage](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/resources/inital.png), the user will notice that the table is unfiltered and there are input boxes to the left of the table.  The filter boxes have placeholder text which provide examples of inputs to enter and the table changes with each user input.  For example, upon entering [1/13/2010](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/resources/date.png) the table shows four entries.  Upon entering the [city](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/resources/city.png), the table returns the data that matches both the city and the date.  There is no need to add a button because the underlying [JavaScript code](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/resources/change%20event.png) "listens" and reacts to a change event.

## Summary:
The main drawback is that the data source is a static [JavaScript file](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/challenge_final/static/js/data.js).  The only way to add new sightings to the current table is by adding them to the data.js file.  Smaller drawbacks include the case-sensitivity of the inputs and the lack of "clean" data.  For example, the table has data for the city of "bonita", however, entering it with a capital ["B"](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/resources/Bonita.png) returns no results.  Additionally, in glancing over the ["duration" column](https://github.com/laurlen2112/UFO/blob/main/resources/clean%20data.png) a user can quickly see that "seconds" is spelled wrong and "minutes" is entered with various abbreviations.

In her next update, Dana should consider creating a Python file that uses Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape the web and return data to the table so it does not become outdated.  She also may want to add flexibility to the inputs so that a search for "bonita" or "Bonita" returns results.  Finally, she should clean the data to make abbreviations uniform and eliminate misspellings.
